  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>Participants were chosen among my friend groups, those who have an affiliation with the WRC were not asked. Those who wished to stay anonymous have been marked as such. Some were asked in person and I summarized their answers, while others were asked to fill out a form and their answers were copy-pasted. Regardless of the method, they were each asked the same 3 questions:</p>
	<li>Question 1: On a scale from 1-10, how much do you actually remember from the presentation?</li>
    <li>Question 2: Any thoughts on the workshop, how it went, how you felt?</li>
    <li>Question 3: What kind of changes would you like to see to improve the experience?</li>
	
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Below are the results of the study:</p>

				<li>my thoughts on the workshop was that it would be more engaging if there was more breakout discussions rather than only telling us about what to do and not to do, i know ppl hate breakout groups but i remember a lot more from my iconnect which was two 45 minute breakout groups more than I remember from fycare I don’t remember if i was in a breakout room for fycare</li>
				<li>what changes is first fire chris, then i guess have more group discussions with prompts and stuff, i understand why uiuc has fycare and iconnect i think it should still be used HOWEVER we are all 18+ so i would hope we wouldn’t need the reminder in college to not assault others or be racist. They could talk about how we should stay safe?</li></td>

				<li>Redundant info, felt like they reiterated the same thing over and over again. Felt like the 2 hour presentation couldve been summed up into a couple bullet points.</li>
				<li>Add incentives to attendance &amp; participation, mentioned having food and small rewards for those who participated the most, instead of just the threat of not being able to register.</li></td>

				<li>I think it was moderately interesting but overall it was an inconvenience because of how much of a time commitment it was and by the time of the actual in person section I didn’t want to pay attention.</li>
				<li>I think it could be more streamlined by either cutting the online part shorter or by not requiring the in person meeting.</li></td>

				<li>I don't remember too much of it. I do remember the interactive aspect of it and thought that that was interesting/ really helped, I guess, understand the material.</li>
				<li>I remember completing the entire thing in like one sitting. I guess if it was longer it could help stick with students. Or if it didn't allow students to speed through it. Then I think people would grasp the information and actually remember what was discussed.</li></td>

				<li>Little long, the information could have been covered faster, if they had gone faster during some of the more “obvious stuff“, and gone straight to the “deep stuff”.</li>
				<li>Some of the facilitators didnt seem motivated or enthusiastic, were kinda just there. The room made it feel like work that had to be done, if it could be done somewhere else then a classroom would feel more welcoming.</li></td>
